## Instructions: Change the laser_callback function to make the robot explore more
## intelligently, using its sensory data (the laser range array).
##
## Advanced: If you want to make use of the robot's mapping subsystem then you can
## make use of the map in the mapping_callback function.

## The following function is a "callback" function that is called back whenever a new laser scan is available.

    ## Alternatively we could have looked at the laser scan BEFORE we made this decision
    ## Well Lets see how we might use a laser scan
    ## Laser scan is an array of distances
    print 'Number of points in laser scan is: ', len(data.ranges)
    print 'The distance to the rightmost scanned point is: ', data.ranges[0]
    print 'The distance to the leftmost scanned point is: ', data.ranges[-1]
    print 'The distance to the middle scanned point is: ', data.ranges[len(data.ranges)/2]
    ## You can use basic trigonometry with the above scan array and the following information to find out exactly where the laser scan found something
    print 'The minimum angle scanned by the laser is: ', data.angle_min
    print 'The maximum angle scanned by the laser is: ', data.angle_max
    print 'The increment in the angles scanned by the laser is: ', data.angle_increment
    ## angle_max = angle_min+angle_increment*len(data.ranges)
    print 'The minimum range (distance) the laser can perceive is: ', data.range_min
    print 'The maximum range (distance) the laser can perceive is: ', data.range_max
    
## You can also make use of the map which is being built by the "gslam_mapping" subsystem
## There is some code here to help but you can understand the API also by looking up the OccupancyGrid message and its members (this is the API for the message)
## If you want me to explain the data structure, I will - just ask me in advance of class
